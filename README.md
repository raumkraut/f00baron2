\#F00 Baron 2
============

After having soundly defeated the Yellow Baron in honourable aerial combat,
the Red Baron finds that a new challenger has taken wing - The Mauve Baron!

F00 Baron 2 is a recreation of a recreation of a game inspired by the
classic Amiga PD game "Biplane Duel", that I use to teach myself new game
engines.
